## Premise
> You're a wizard, Harry.

This is a virtual spellcasting demo in which you take control of your "wand"
(i.e. your phone) and cast spell(s). It was created as a final project for
the Harry Potter DeCal at UC Berkeley. The idea is that the user would hold
his/her smartphone in front of a computer while calling out an incantation and
brandishing the phone "wand." On-screen the user would be able to see his/her
wand moving around, along with the effect of the spell that he/she casts.

## Spell List
- Wingardium Leviosa
- Lumos
- Nox

## Notes
- You cannot move your feet in-world.
- I don't intend to put much work into the scene, but if I were an artist
  and/or knew some modeling artists with free time, it could obviously look a lot better.
