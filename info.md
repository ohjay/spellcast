## Premise
> You're a wizard, Harry.

This is a spellcasting demo in which you take control of your "wand" (i.e. your phone) and cast spell(s).
It was created as a final project for the Harry Potter DeCal at UC Berkeley.

## Spell List
- Wingardium Leviosa
- Lumos
- Nox

## Notes
- You cannot move your feet in-world.
- I don't intend to put much work into the scene, but if I were an artist
  and/or knew some modeling artists with free time, it could obviously look a lot better.
